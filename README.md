# Multiplayer Snake Game  
The Snake Game offers three different modes to cater to different gameplay preferences: Basic Mode, Infinite Mode, and Multiplayer Mode. Each mode provides a unique twist to the classic snake game experience.  
## Basic Mode  
In Basic Mode, the game follows the traditional rules of the snake game. The player controls a snake and navigates it within a walled area. The objective is to eat food and grow while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. If the snake hits any of the walls, it will result in immediate death and the game will end.  
## Infinite Mode
In Infinite Mode, the game removes the walls that typically surround the snake's play area. This means that the snake can freely move beyond the boundaries without any restrictions. The objective remains the same: eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the snake's own body. With no walls to confine the snake, players have more freedom to navigate and strategize their moves.  
## Multiplayer Mode
Multiplayer Mode introduces a competitive element to the snake game. Two players can engage in head-to-head gameplay on the same screen. The rules vary slightly from the other modes. When a player's snake dies, instead of ending the game, they enter a brief 3-second interval of respawn time. After this interval, the player's snake is revived and they can continue playing. The objective is to survive and score as many points as possible. At the end of a predefined time limit or when both players have died, the player with the higher score wins the game.
